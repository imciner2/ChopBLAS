    # As of January 19, 2022, the MATLAB action has undocumented support for Windows and MacOS shared runners
    # (https://github.com/matlab-actions/setup-matlab/issues/18#issuecomment-1006990188). This is in version
    # 1.1.0 of the action, and only provides the bare Matlab and Simulink products with no toolboxes.
    #
    # The test suite now uses the half-precision data type, which is in the Fixed Point Designer toolbox,
    # so the test suite can't be run on the Windows or macOS shared runners currently.
